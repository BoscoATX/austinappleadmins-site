Hey y'all! It was great to see so many of you out this week for our event sponsored by [HostGator](http://www.hostgator.com/about).


Many thanks to [Erik Gomez](http://blog.eriknicolasgomez.com/) from [Pinterest](https://about.pinterest.com/en) and [Joel Rennich](https://gitlab.com/Mactroll) of [Trusource Labs](https://www.trusourcelabs.com/) for sharing some of the amazing things they're working on.

Here are my introductory slides:
