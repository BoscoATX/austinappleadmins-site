Hey y'all! We're pleased to announce our next event celebrating the second anniversary of the Austin Apple Admins meetup group!

On June 14th, 2017, we are planning a happy hour at [The Beer Plant](http://thebeerplant.com/)! Bring your friends, co-workers, significant others, and anyone else that might enjoy a fun night at The Beer Plant. We'd appreciate an RSVP so we can make sure we snag enough tables for everyone to sit together.
