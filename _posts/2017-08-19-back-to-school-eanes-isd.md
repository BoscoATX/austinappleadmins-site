Assistant IT Director [Chris Miller](https://twitter.com/EdTechChris) will be sharing his insights on how Eanes ISD scaled their MDM for the school year. Emily will also revisit tools that every Apple Admin should have in their toolbox (pencilcase? trapper keeper?). Food and drinks will be provided by Jamf (thanks!).
