We had a great time hearing from Chris Miller of [Eanes ISD](https://www.eanesisd.net/dept/tech) on how they scaled their MDM for the school year. Thanks again to Jamf for providing tasty pizza!

Below are the assets from the meetup, including the main deck, Chris's presentation, and a recording of the Facebook Live video.
