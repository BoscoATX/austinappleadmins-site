Well I've promised swag for probably a year now, and we finally have some!

Texas Apple Admins 2017 sticker, 3" x 2.85"

### How to get yours

Find me (Emily) at the JNUC or come to a future meetup and grab one while they last. If you live outside of the area and would like a sticker I'll post details on how that will work after the conference.

### Until next time...

If you'd like to speak at a future meetup in Austin please [let us know](https://goo.gl/forms/SlplkdmkkyKpG7982).
