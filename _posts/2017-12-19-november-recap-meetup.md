December 19, 2017 - November Meetup Recap and Resources

---

Thanks to everyone that came out on November 20th for our last meetup at [Trusource Labs](https://www.trusourcelabs.com/)! It was great to hear from David Kennedy ([Jamf](https://www.jamf.com/) and Joel Rennich ([NoMAD](https://nomad.menu/)), and doubly-great to have tacos and Topo Chico (thanks Jamf!). Keep reading for the resources and recorded video from the meetup.

## Slide Deck

Here is the evening's slide deck. Note that the presentations were mostly live demos, so the slides are mostly informative though not directly related to the presos. Included at the end of the slides are links to the "Things to know" topics I mentioned that night.
