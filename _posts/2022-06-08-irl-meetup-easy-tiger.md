June 9 - IRL Happy Hour at Easy Tiger

---

Hey y'all! Come on down to [Easy Tiger North at Linc](https://www.easytigerusa.com/location/north/) for an IRL, meat-space, happy hour gathering! We'll chat about WWDC, love, life, and food. Let's say 4-ish? Feel free to come and go as you can. It'll be great to see your happy faces again, no continuity camera required. Friends, family, co-coworkers, and loved ones are all invited.

Join us in the [#austin](https://macadmins.slack.com/archives/C07F1R56E) channel on the [Mac Admins Slack](https://macadmins.org/slack) if you have any questions or want to join the general conversation.
