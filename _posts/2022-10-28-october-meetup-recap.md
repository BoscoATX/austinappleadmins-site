Thank you to everyone that came out for this month's return to in-person meetups at [Jamf's](https://www.jamf.com/contact/) Austin office. Special thanks to the [Jamf Nation User Group](https://community.jamf.com/t5/user-groups/ct-p/jamf-user-groups) program from the Community team for providing pizza üçï and drinks ü•§!

Even though we didn't have a set agenda there was plenty to talk about! The conversation started with macOS Ventura and lead us through talking about many of the great tools and utilities out there that many of us use at our organizations. I've added the items we discussed to the slide deck below (and added a few others we didn't).
